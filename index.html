		<p> Hello sir or madam, thanks for visiting my github page! I initially created this account for a college course (web programming) and 
			the work I've put on it was mostly done in private repositories (to keep clever classmates and underclassmen from stealing our
			work for our class projects. I plan to start using it again, beginning with this bibliography/intro page and resume page. For 
			the near future, I plan on adding a projects page showing a rough outline of my school projects and hobby projects. Until then,
			I hope these few pages provide you with quality information. </p>
		<p> As for who I am, I'm a recently graduated (2018) Electrical Engineer! I chose the major because I think electrical engineering 
			most aligns with my vision for the future. A future of fully electrical systems powered by fully renewable sources of energy (okay,
			this might be more aligned with nuclear/chemical engineering... but I digress). For a more selfish reason, I wanted to learn more
			about electronics for some hobbyist projects using arduinos and raspberry pis. I enjoy hands-on work including designing, research, 
			prototyping, and redesigning. I'm a fan of both hardware and software, and I like to know the interaction between the two. Furthermore,
			I like to know techonology works; from the transistors to the algorithms, I'm interested in the 'full stack' if you will. Any career
			that aligns with either my dream of a sustainable & advanced future or my pursuit of knowledge in electronics design (or both) would
			be ideal for me. </p>
		<p> As for my non-career focused self, the two big categories that self-improvement and entertainment. <br />
		    Self-improvement: I spend time learning a huge variety of information through online classes, books, podcasts, and other internet sources.
			I've been interested primarily interested in economics, politics, electronics, physics, and languages. <br />
		    Entertainment: I rotate between athletic activities such as rock climbing and tennis and more casual activities such as reading, playing videogames,
			or playing music. </p>

      <h2> Foreword </h2>
	    <div class="w3-container w3-padding-8 w3-theme-d2">
			<p> What is a name? </p>
			<p> A name is but an identifier, something to differentiate yourself from others. Over time; however, it becomes something greater. 
				It becomes who you are; it becomes difficult to separate yourself from that name. </p>	
			<p>	I have and always will be Anthony Nguyen, but that name doesn't quite satisfy the underlying reason for a name. 
				It fails (at least more than other names) in giving me a unique identifier. I've been acquainted with more than
				just a few other Anthony Nguyens. Surprisingly, I've never met a John Smith.   </p>
		</div>

      <h2> Section 3 Subsection 37 </h2>
		<div class="w3-container w3-padding-8 w3-theme-d2">
			<p> Let's take it back to the beginning, a name is but a word. And before language, a name is but a set of sounds. 
				And a set of sounds is but a collection of frequencies. And a set of frequencies is but a set of waves at specific 
				energy levels. You would not be wrong in saying that calling my name is a transfer of energy. </p>
		</div>
		
      <h2> Closing Arguments </h2>
	  	<div class="w3-container w3-padding-8 w3-theme-d2">
			<p> You are your name. In the end, I definitely feel like an Anthony Nguyen. I guess that's all that matters. </p>
