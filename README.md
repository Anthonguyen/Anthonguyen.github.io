This assignment correctly set up my tufts website to redirect to my github account. This assignment also correctly set up a bio.html, resume.html, and index.html with the appropriate permissions such that it appears on the website. These html files use style.css to style the text, while the html files provide the content.
This lab took about 4 hours.
I tasked with Vincent Tran about some concepts of this assignment.
